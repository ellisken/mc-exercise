Lab 15 Merge Conflict Exercise

**Lessons learned from lab**
***Instructions***
Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.

* Bob & Carol should have pulled from the remote master branch after the first PR was merged. That's why it's suggested to yell 'PULL!' every time a merge occurs so that everyone else working on development branches can checkout master, pull, checkout their dev branch, and merge from master.

* Ted and Alice committed changes and did a pull request with errors.  We were able to resolve the conflicts and continue the branch merge.
